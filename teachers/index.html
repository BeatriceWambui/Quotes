              The main idea behind My health My choice company is to connect hospitals around the continent and riching out to all people to help

                                                     <h3 class="p">The CEO</h3>
              <p> The company was from self insipation.After observing what many peolpe were going through trying to connect to hospitals with the best services for their illnesses and it was abit difficult.This is when I decided to come up with a solution where one wwould directly access thea health facity which is best in what they are suffering from.Its Gods doing this far.</p>
              
                                                      <h3 class="p">Nutritionist advice</h3>
    <div class="lists">
             <p>As a qualified nutritionist I advice fellow humans to take keen note on the foods they take. Junk foods are not recomended to be taken for two
             consecutive meals. It is always best to take home made food atleast twice in a day. Vegetables are healthy foods that are highly recommended. Most
             people suffer from malicious illness because of what they consume.<strong>Eat healthy live healthy</strong> 
             Below are some decieses brought about by unheathy feeding. Water is a source of life.You should take alot of water for a healthier living.</p>
